<h2>Sports</h2>
</li>
<p1>As you know I have been playing hockey for a long time and still practice when I have the time.i just love the feeling of playing a sport with your team mates.i love all kinds of sports but my preferred ones are hockey,football,basketball,cricket,kabaddi,badminton and table tennis.</p1>
<li><h2>Cooking</h2></li>
<p2>Now you must not assume that im a good cook xD.i have the skills of an amateur but I want to learn a lot of things about cooking, not only because it fascinates me but also because I believe everyone should know how to cook their own food and not be dependent on anyone to feed themselves. I want to master  indian cooking and make everything my mom and grandma make for me.</p2>
<li><h2>Others</h2></li>
<p3>I love nature and exploring new places.Village life interests me a lot.I love the simple things in life like old hindi music,flowers,paintings,novels and good movies.I am currently trying to figure out what I want to do in my career as I want to do something that makes me happy.I shall  stop here otherwise I will go on and on(Warning:Iâ€™m a chatterbox xD).</p3>
